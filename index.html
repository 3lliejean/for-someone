                <p>Dear Muazzin,</p>
                <p>Thank you! Yes, I'd say that again. Twice. Thrice. A Million times over. But have I ever told you the
                    reason behind it? I may have, but heck, there are a lot of reasons. Every day, every night, every
                    passing moment, I was and will be grateful to you. Yes, I too have this question in my mind. "What
                    did I do to deserve this?" A human being often disgraces himself. Why? That is a question for
                    myself. Back then, I really humbled and humiliated myself in front of myself. At one moment and
                    another, I really thought I was a shame. A curse. I remember how I used to humiliate myself, hurt
                    myself. Cried myself to sleep only to wake up and suffer with it all over again. I was at a point
                    where either I had to
                    solve this or end this misery with myself. But what could I do? Was I capable of anything? <br>
                    <i>"My Creator. My Lord. The Ever-Hearing. What did I do to deserve this? Why are you letting this
                        all happen?"</i>... <br><i>"I challenge you. If you're there, actually there and listening, if
                        you really want me on your path, if it's all real, then bring me out of this misery, with any of
                        your miracles. I don't care how and when, or I am never sitting here again, in front of you,
                        ever again!"</i><br>
                    And suddenly, I was free. I was over the moon, for some reason. He wasn't real. Nothing was. No hope
                    anymore. No humiliation. I don't have to show any courage or patience to get over it. I guess I
                    lived exactly how I wanted.<br>
                    Until one midnight, I was sitting in front of someone I had known long before, for someone I had
                    never known. I cried,
                    but not with tears. I was sitting with a continuous pain in my heart. After a long time, I felt an
                    emotion. Little did I know, this was that miracle. Little did I know that the Ever-Knowing, the
                    Ever-Hearing, heard me. I was back. You gave me myself back. I know I've told you this many times
                    before, too, but no words can ever describe the emotions and events I went through before you, and
                    during you.
                    And, this is just one of the many, many reasons why I am so grateful to you, for you. Tell me, if it
                    were you instead of me, wouldn't you wish to sacrifice your everything to payback, knowing that it
                    will still not be enough?
                    <br>
                    Then, another night, I sat in front of Him. I was pleading for forgiveness, and in the other moment,
                    I
                    was thanking Him
                    for everything. I felt guilty, and in the other moment, I felt as if I were the luckiest person
                    right
                    now. I was calling Him
                    again and again. I was calling you. That was when everything made sense to me, and everything that I
                    went through felt worth it. Back then, I knew I was a great sinner. Yet, I resisted everything. I
                    was trapped, everything was suffocating me. I knew that He didn't love me anymore. I tried never to
                    care about it. But I did care about it. Then? <i>"And trust me, you're the kind of person beloved to
                        Allah, He would never leave you alone, no matter what. We don't know each other that much for
                        now, but the more I get to know you, you're from people of Jannah with hearts of birds." </i>
                    Nothing is by chance, and nothing goes in vain. <i>"Oh Muazzin! You're so lucky that He chose
                        you"</i> I cried. What
                    a perfect name you have,
                    Muazzin. The more I got close to you, the more I trusted and believed in Him, and the closer I got
                    to Him.
                    <br>
                    To be very honest, I don't know what love is and what it's like. And to be fair, I am not in a hurry
                    to know that. All I know is that you know it's right when you don't lose yourself, you find more of
                    yourself.
                    <br>
                    You're ideal. You've seen the deepest, most bruised parts of me and still wished to stay. How long
                    have we been together? Hardly a year. Yet you exposed me to myself.
                    <br>
                    I don't want to end this. I want to keep writing because it feels like I am talking to you, and one
                    only loves to talk with someone who is listening.
                    You gave me confidence. The confidence I never had. Now, I feel like I am living.
                    <br>
                    Don't get bored with my 'Thank You' because I will say that often from now on. And do not always
                    seek a reason behind it because, most of the time, it's the realization that I've come so far, so
                    far away from my problems, only because I knew you were with me no matter what. <i>Is this love?</i>
                    I don't know. All I know is that no prayer, no pain, no suffering, nothing goes in vain. You made me
                    believe this. You made me believe in love.
                    <br>
                    Oh, and the main reason behind writing all of this before stepping into the next year with you is
                    that
                    you made me feel seen, heard, and blessed. 2023 and 2024 were the worst years of my life. 2025? The
                    year I will remember forever. Who knows what's coming next? All I know is that you're coming with
                    me. I am also aware of the upcoming storms, which you and I both have to deal with. New year, new
                    problems I guess, but it will be different this time. We have each other now. We both have someone
                    to share our thoughts and our feelings with. To talk about our failures and celebrate our successes.
                    <br>
                    ...Every precious and beautiful thing reminds me of you now. Flowers and books remind me of you a
                    lot.
                    That pretty sunset reminds me of you. The golden hour reminds me of you. Almost everything reminds
                    me of you.
                    <br>
                    I expressed too much, didn't I? However, I do want you to know about my thoughts and my feelings. I
                    just hope they don't become another burden on your shoulders.
